- /api/platform/linkedin/cookies  GET  None  get the cookies of the linkedin session

## run the app as script
if you want to run the app directly, not through the server, run the following command:

create a copy of the json file, input/sample_user.json, and fill in the details, then run the following command
```bash
python3 appCLI.py --json-file input/your_user.json --login-linkedin --jobs-search --jobs-apply
```
the options are:
- --json-file: 

the path to the json file (required):
the json file should be in the folder input/
the json file is used to configure the app
make sure the json file is fully configured
- --login-linkedin: 

use login command to login to linkedin (required only once), then the app will keep the session alive using the cookie file.
- --jobs-search: 

use jobs-search command to search for jobs. the jobs are stored inside jobApp/data as csv file. 
- --jobs-apply: 
use jobs-apply command to apply for jobs saved inside jobApp/data as csv file. if the jobs are already applied, the app will not apply for them again. the app will update the csv file with the new status of the job.
