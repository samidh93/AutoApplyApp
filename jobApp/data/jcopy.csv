The lack of natural, high-quality products on the market provided the original motivation for founding Sunday Natural in 2013. We want to produce exactly the products we would like to buy ourselves. As natural as possible, absolutely pure, free of all additives and with the highest possible quality. Sunday Natural is purely privately financed, independent and today one of the renowned German quality manufacturers, with its own research and development department in Berlin. We cooperate with selected research institutes, scientists, therapists, farmers and professional associations for the continuous development of our products.We take our ecological responsibility very seriously: Our entire range is therefore vegan and - with a few exceptions - vegetarian. We also go our own way when it comes to packaging: the majority of our products are packaged in glass and are therefore almost completely recyclable.We have a diverse team of 170 people, still growing but in a healthy speed. Our aim is to work in a collaborative, supportive and encouraging work environment with a diverse group of motivated, talented, and visionary colleagues.
